# Introduction

I have a long track record of having multiple backups that I've made over the two decades, I realized that there are by far too many copies of files.
Moving to a new server (NAS, DIY), I have decided to work on the issue. With a help from my colleague at work and some Internet forums and ChatGPT, I came to a point where I am able to build something useful.

## Assumptions

Script: script-hash_files_size_to_csv.sh:
1. SHA256 is calculated for each of the files
2. A relative file path is recorded
3. A file size is calculated

All the above are then listed in a CSV file.
